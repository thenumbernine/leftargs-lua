-- parser needs ; now to know when stmts end ...

print'HelloWorld';
('Hello World') -> print;
local function add(a,b) return a + b end;
(2, 2) -> add;
(add) -> print;
--add -> print;	-- can't remove () ... unless I make -> an expr ... but you can't have single-expr stmts without assignments...
((2, 2) -> add) -> print;
(2, 2) -> add -> print;		-- chaining now works
((2,2) -> add, 2) -> add -> print;

-- how about with indexes:

t={};
t.k=print;
(2,2) -> t.k;
(2,2) -> t['k'];
(t,2,2) -> t['k'];
--(2,2) -> t:k ;	-- not working yet

x = (2,2) -> add;
(x) -> print;
-- here's one selling points: now function inputs are next to lambda outputs ...
x = (2,3) -> (function(x,y) return x^y end);
-- langfix shorthand would look like this:
--x = (2,3) -> ([x,y] x^y);
-- would be nice if I could get rid of the parenthesis ...
(x) -> print;
